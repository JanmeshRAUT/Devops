   DEPRECATED: UserManagement.css
   ========================================================================
   
   This file is DEPRECATED as of 2026-01-03.
   All UserManagement styles have been consolidated into AdminDashboard.css
   to serve as the single source of truth for admin panel styling.
   
   Classes that were here:
   - .user-management-container
   - .user-mgmt-*
   - .user-reg-*
   
   This file is kept for backward compatibility but should no longer be edited.
   Any changes should be made in AdminDashboard.css instead.
   
   REMOVE THIS FILE AFTER CONFIRMING NO REGRESSIONS.

/* All styles now in AdminDashboard.css */
